# my-editor

- The editor is written in Draft.js
    - Typing `#` as the first string in a line & pressing space should make anything you type afterwards on the same line be in a “Heading” format. On pressing space the aforementioned `#` should disappear.
    - See “This is a heading” line in the layout image above.
    - Similarly, typing `*` as the first string in a line and pressing space should correspond to “bold” format.
    - `**` and space = red line
    - `***` and space = underline
- Pressing `Save` button should persist everything typed in the editor into `localstorage`. On refreshing the page,  the saved info should be refilled into the editor.
